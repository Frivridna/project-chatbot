# Project Name

This is the third project made in the Technigo Bootcamp. It was a pair programming project that consisted in building a ChatBot by using JavaScript. 
We have created a HelpMeChooseBot that gives the user movie options after answering a few questions.

## The problem

This was our first pair programming project in the course of Technigo. The first day we set up how and when to work together to achieve a schedule that fitted both of our lives. We initially started building the bot with another idea in mind, and at the end of day one changed our idea to a HelpMeChooseBot. The code was generic at that point so it was easy for us to switch idea. 

We have focused on the JavaScript for this project and built the code from top to bottom outlining the bigger structure first which gave us the challenge of combining several different options for the user into a list of options based on what they chose at the end. Upon encountering this problem we’ve asked our teammates and help-channel in Slack, google, and Stack overflow to solve it. 

The collaboration was generous in communication which is also something that was of huge help to building the bot, and to sticking to our plan on when to finish it.

If there was more time we would have researched different chatbot genres more before starting in order to come up with an idea that could make it stick out in the huge amount of bots today. As their building blocks are similar to each other, it seems that the concept of the ‘chat’ in the bot is what could give it an edge. We would then also have been able to address biases in bots.
